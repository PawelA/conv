Assignment for an operating systems class.

The task was to write a 32-bit to 64-bit ET_REL ELF converter.
The converter takes in a list of function signatures and inserts
appropriate stubs for switching between 32 and 64 bit modes.

The files test.c, shuf.c, and the makefile demonstrate the usage.
Notice how the 32-bit function shuffle uses an external 64-bit
function from the C stdandard library.

The file stub.s is a reference for the stub generator. stub.c
simply runs the main function from stub.s.
